Crystal AR: Interactive Sorting Algorithms Visualizer
Overview
Crystal AR is an innovative web-based educational platform designed to make learning sorting algorithms engaging and intuitive. Built as a second-year project for Engineering Design Innovation (EDI) at Vishwakarma Institute of Technology (VIT), Pune, this project transforms abstract computer science concepts into interactive visualizations. Users can watch algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort in action, experiment with custom inputs, compare their performance, and even explore real-world applications.
The platform emphasizes hands-on learning through live animations, code breakdowns in C++, quizzes, and an AI-powered doubt solver. Augmented Reality (AR) integration for 3D projections is planned for future enhancements (coming soon).
This is a proof-of-concept developed by a team of four second-year engineering students passionate about blending education with emerging technologies like AR/VR.

Learn

Interactive Visualizations: Step-by-step animations of five core sorting algorithms with customizable speed, randomization, and custom array inputs.
Performance Metrics: Real-time tracking of comparisons, swaps, time elapsed, and dynamic charts.
Code Practice: Toggle between viewing C++ implementations and practicing your own code with feedback.
Quizzes: 10-question assessments per algorithm with explanations and retake options.
Supports arrays up to 50 elements for smooth performance.

Applications

Real-World Scenarios Gallery: Interactive demos showing algorithm usage in:

Quick Sort: Database query sorting (e.g., users by registration date).
Merge Sort: E-commerce product catalogs (stable sorting by price).
Insertion Sort: Live social media feeds (inserting new posts by likes).
Bubble Sort: Simple game leaderboards (small-scale score sorting).
Selection Sort: Embedded systems (minimizing swaps for task priorities).


Each scenario includes reset buttons and visual highlights for comparisons/swaps.
